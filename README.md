The "Snake Water Gun" game is a basic JavaScript implementation of a Rock-Paper-Scissors-like game. Players interact with the game through prompt, confirm, and console instead of a graphical interface. The game randomly selects the computer’s choice and compares it with the player's input to determine the winner using predefined rules:
        - Snake drinks Water (Snake wins).
        - Water douses Gun (Water wins).
        - Gun kills Snake (Gun wins).

 It demonstrates essential programming concepts like random number generation, conditional statements, and basic user interaction through JavaScript’s built-in dialog methods.

 This is a light program that enables beginners to learn essential concepts of programming in a fun way.
